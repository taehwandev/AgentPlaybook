# Document Conventions

Use when creating, reviewing, routing, or naming generated project documents
such as PRDs, specs, ARDs, feature folders, and module implementation docs.

## Read

- `references/current-guidance.md` for generated document path, naming, and
  override-order rules.
- Repo-local document instructions before applying these shared defaults.

## Process

1. Check repo-local document paths and naming rules first.
2. Use the feature-folder convention only when repo-local instructions do not
   define a different location.
3. Keep project-level PRD, spec, and ARD files together unless the document is
   explicitly module implementation detail.
4. Report the created or changed document path, status (`draft`, `review`, or
   `stable`), and next step.

## Do Not

- Do not create empty placeholder documents.
- Do not put project-level PRDs inside module implementation folders.
- Do not override repo-local document conventions with this shared default.

## Verification

- Confirm generated document paths match repo-local rules or this fallback.
- Confirm route/index references load this `SKILL.md` entrypoint:
  `rg -n "common/skills/doc-conventions/SKILL.md|Document Output Conventions|planning_change_documentation" AGENTS.md workflow-doc-surfaces.json index.md`
- For routing changes, run a route smoke and confirm this path appears:
  `python3 scripts/workflow.py route docs --request "기획 변경 문서 정리" --concern skills`
